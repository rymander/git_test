This is Ryan's first git project

it is july 29, 2022 and I am relearning git to redo the foundations course in the Odin Project


It is April 6 2023 I am back learning Vim and relearning everything I learned last year due to having 7 months off.

I'm showing this to Maria in bed.


It is January 22nd 2024. I have fully commited to linux on this laptop to learn web development. I am giving myself 6 months to become employable. I will get there by studying 6-8 hours per day for at least 3 days a week for the next 6 months.
